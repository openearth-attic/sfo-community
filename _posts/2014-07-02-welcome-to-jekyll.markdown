The Bay-Delta model applies the D-Flow FM software package to the
Bay-Delta area. The model will be calibrated for water level and
discharge throughout the Bay-Delta area, as well as for suspended
sediment concentrations (SSC), salinity and water temperature.
Coupling with DelWaq software allows for advanced modeling of water
quality and ecological parameters such as phytoplankton, bivalves and
fish habitats.
